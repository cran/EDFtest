Title: Goodness of Fit Based on Empirical Distribution Function
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2021-10-22
Description: This repository contains software for the calculation of goodness-of-fit test statistics and their P-values. The three statistics computed are the Empirical Distribution function statistics called Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, and Watson statistics. The statistics and their P-values can be used to assess an assumed distribution.The following distributions are available: Uniform, Normal, Gamma, Logistic, Laplace, Weibull, Extreme Value, and Exponential.
