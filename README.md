# EDFtest
This package contains software for the calculation of goodness-of-fit
test statistics and their P-values. The three statistics computed are the
Empirical Distribution function statistics called Cram√©r-von Mises, Anderson-Darling,
and Watson statistic.  

The statistics and their P-values can be used to assess an assumed distribution. In the simplest situation
you have an i.i.d. sample from some distribution F and want to test the hypothesis that the sample is drawn from
a distribution F which belongs to a specified parametric family of distributions against the alternative that 
F is not equal to any member of that parametric family. The following families are available:
Uniform(min, max),
Normal(location, scale),
Gamma(shape, scale),
Logistic(location, scale),
Laplace(location, scale),
Weibull(shape, scale),
Extreme Value(shape, scale), and
Exponential(scale).

This package also contains function `gof.sandwich` which performs Goodness-of-Fit tests for general distributions
using Sandwich estimation of covariance function. This function tests the hypothesis that data y come from 
distribution `Fdist` with unknown parameter values theta. Estimates of theta must be provided.
It uses a large sample approximation to the limit distribution based on the use of the score function components
to estimate the Fisher information and the limiting covariance function of the empirical process.

## Installation
There are several ways you can install GitHub packages into R. For example,
You can install our package by using `devtools`. You need to install `devtools` package first if you have not.


Step 1: Install the `devtools` package
```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Step 2: Install our `EDFtest` package and attach it
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("LiYao-sfu/EDFtest")
library("EDFtest")
```

## Troubleshooting
This package is still under development. EDF test for regression models and discrete distributions 
will be available for the future releases.

If you encounter a clear bug, You could create an issue on GitHub. For other questions, please contact Li Yao by <yaoliy@sfu.ca>.
